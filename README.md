# HomeManagementSystemUsingJava
Project done by :
1. Arun Kochukadavil (mainly Back-end)
2. Dhruvil Mehta (mainly Front-end)

It is a simple approach to make a project in java using our basic java(gui in swing) and dbms(using sqlite) knowledge we have. We are open for suggestion as we are new to project making as it will improve our skill and make our project more better.
